(** * Checked signatures: the steps

    [wf_checked Σ]: the signature is built from the empty one by checked
    steps, each a registration of lectures 7 and 8 through the kernel's
    checker:
    - a declaration by algorithm 1 with strict positivity and the checked
      category of elimination ([declare_checked]), with its instances;
    - a δ-constant whose body checks against its type and passes the
      guard of every [fix] ([define_checked]);
    - functions compiled by algorithm 2 ([compile_all]).
    The modes [Bypass] of positivity and [BypassElim] are not steps, nor
    is any assumption: every constant has a body or active ι-rules.  The
    steps check in the predicative hierarchy, with or without Prop.

    The record of a signature carries a proof of closedness; the
    functions of the kernel and of erasure read only its entries, so
    [wf_checked] holds of every signature with the entries of a checked
    one.  [run_steps] replays a list of steps, and [steps_checked] turns
    a successful replay into [wf_checked]. *)
